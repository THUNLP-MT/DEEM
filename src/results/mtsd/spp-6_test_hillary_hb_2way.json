The use of the term 'slammed' suggests criticism or attack, and the mention of her name in relation to a bill that was ultimately signed into law by Obama could be seen as an attempt to discredit her or undermine her credibility. Overall, this sentence reflects the polarized nature of political discourse surrounding Hillary Clinton.\"\nSocial_Media_Expert: \"Looking at this sentence from a social media perspective, it appears to be critical of Hillary Clinton. Social media often amplifies strong emotions and polarizing views. The use of 'slammed' suggests a negative sentiment, and the mention of her name in relation to a bill that was ultimately signed into law by Obama could be seen as an attempt to discredit her or undermine her credibility. Social media platforms are known for hosting diverse and sometimes conflicting viewpoints, and this sentence reflects that dynamic.\"\nIrony_expert: \"As an irony expert, it's clear that this sentence is laced with sarcasm and irony. The mention of Hillary Clinton being critical of Bernie Sanders for a bill that was ultimately signed into law by Obama suggests a humorous and exaggerated take on the political process. The use of 'slammed' may be mocking her criticism of Bernie Sanders. This sentence is likely meant to be taken with a grain of humor and satire, typical in political commentary.\"\n\nThe attitude of the sentence is against Hillary Clinton."

The use of 'full blown socialist' and 'crusty & dusty' suggests a humorous and exaggerated take on Bernie Sanders' political ideology and age.

The use of the term 'skewer' suggests a desire to attack or criticize her, and the mention of the DNC voter database issue implies that there is some wrongdoing or controversy surrounding her campaign. Overall, this sentence reflects a critical view of Hillary Clinton's candidacy.\"\nSocial_Media_Expert: \"Looking at this sentence from a social media perspective, it appears to be a call to action for Bernie Sanders supporters to be more aggressive in their criticism of Hillary Clinton. Social media often amplifies strong emotions and polarizing views, and this sentence reflects that dynamic. The use of the hashtag #Hillary and #DNC suggests that the sentence is part of a larger conversation or debate on social media.\"\nIrony_expert: \"As an irony expert, it's worth noting that the sentence uses the phrase 'plays nice,' which is often associated with children's behavior. This could be interpreted as a subtle dig at Hillary Clinton's perceived lack of authenticity or sincerity. Additionally, the use of the word 'skewer' suggests a violent or aggressive action, which is ironic given that the sentence is calling for Bernie Sanders to be more forceful in his criticism of Hillary Clinton.\" \n\nThe attitude of the sentence is against Hillary Clinton."

The use of the hashtag #TechDummyCard suggests that the author believes Clinton is incompetent when it comes to technology. Additionally, the mention of the #Sandersgate data breach implies that Clinton is being hypocritical in her criticism of others' handling of sensitive information. Overall, this sentence reflects a critical view of Clinton's abilities and actions.\"\nSocial_Media_Expert: \"Looking at this sentence from a social media perspective, it appears to be primarily critical of Hillary Clinton. Social media often amplifies negative views and criticism, and this sentence is no exception. The use of hashtags like #TechDummyCard and #Sandersgate data breach suggest that the author is trying to draw attention to perceived flaws in Clinton's character and actions. Social media platforms are known for hosting diverse and sometimes conflicting viewpoints, and this sentence reflects a critical perspective.\"\nIrony_expert: \"As an irony expert, it's clear that this sentence is laced with sarcasm and irony. The mention of the infamous 'cloth' comment and the suggestion that Clinton is playing the 'TechDummyCard' suggests a humorous and exaggerated take on her perceived lack of technological savvy. The use of the hashtag #Sandersgate data breach may be mocking Clinton's involvement in the controversy. This sentence is likely meant to be taken with a grain of humor and satire, typical in political commentary.\"\n\nThe attitude of the sentence is against Hillary Clinton."
