            "As an expert on Cuban politics, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet expresses a negative view towards politicians with ties to Cuba, which could be seen as a criticism of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. However, it also suggests support for Donald Trump, who has had business dealings in Cuba in the past. This could be seen as inconsistent or hypocritical, depending on the author's views on the matter.",
