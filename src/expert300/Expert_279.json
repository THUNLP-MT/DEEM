            "As a sociology expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet seems to be making a broader point about the existence of a racist underclass in American society, which is not limited to Trump's supporters. However, the tweet does associate Trump with this underclass, which could be seen as a negative stance towards him.",
            "#Trump2016 inherited Nixon's scared old white racist underclass. They demand attention & also exist in the #democraticparty.  #Hillary2016"
