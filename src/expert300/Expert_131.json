            "As a social psychology expert, I can analyze the tweet's language and tone to suggest that the author is expressing a strong negative sentiment towards Bernie Sanders and his supporters. The use of derogatory language and the lack of any substantive criticism suggests a strong bias against Bernie Sanders and his supporters.",
            "Every #Hillary or #Bernie supporter I know is a fucking retard... I'm not even kidding. The most sheltered and naive people ever."

            "From a social psychology perspective, this tweet reflects a common phenomenon known as the \"halo effect.\" People tend to view attractive or successful individuals more positively, while those who lack these qualities are viewed more negatively. The author's statement that they cannot relate to someone who has never waited in line for anything suggests a negative view of Hillary Clinton's perceived privilege and lack of relatability.",
            "I cannot relate to a person who has never waited in line for anything. I will not vote for #DonaldTrump or #HillaryClinton."
