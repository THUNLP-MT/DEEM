            "As an expert on Texan culture, I can provide some context for this tweet. Texas is a traditionally conservative state, and many Texans may be inclined to support Republican candidates like Ted Cruz or Donald Trump. However, the tweet expresses a negative view of Cruz, which could be seen as a departure from the typical Texan political stance.",
            "Yeah...I'm a Texan but that doesn't mean I want #TedCruz in the White House! DON'T TRUST the man...just a Politician. #Trump2016 #TrumpTrain"
