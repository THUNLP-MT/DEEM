            "As an expert on extremism, I can say that this tweet reflects a biased and inaccurate view of left-wing extremism. The tweet suggests that left-wing extremism is responsible for the country's problems, which is not supported by evidence. Additionally, the tweet implies that Bernie Sanders is responsible for left-wing extremism, which is a baseless accusation.",
            "#Bernie sez he and #Hillary are working to defeat right-wing extremism. Meanwhile the country reels from 8 years of left-wing extremism."
