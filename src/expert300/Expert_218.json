            "From an emotion analysis perspective, the tweet contains negative sentiment towards Hillary Clinton. The use of the words \"artificial\" and \"not convincing\" suggests a lack of trust or belief in her abilities. The positive sentiment towards Bernie Sanders and negative sentiment towards O'Malley further reinforce the negative stance towards Clinton.",
            "My intake about last nite debate: #Hillary:artificial,not convincing. #Bernie:Angry,passionate, makes sense.O'Malley:Robotic and irrelevant."
