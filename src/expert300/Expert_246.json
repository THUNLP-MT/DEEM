            "As an animal expert, I can provide a different perspective. The use of the phrase \"monkeys\" in this tweet is a derogatory term that is often used to insult people. However, it is important to note that monkeys are intelligent and social animals that play an essential role in many ecosystems. Using them as a metaphor for incompetence or chaos is not accurate or fair to the animals.",
