            "As a veteran expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet suggests that veterans should not vote for Hillary Clinton, which could be interpreted as a negative stance towards her. However, it's important to note that veterans have diverse political views and opinions, and not all veterans may share the same stance towards Hillary Clinton.",
            "Thanks for the thanks today. If you really want to thank a vet, do us a favor and don't vote for #Hillary in 2016. #Trump2016 #Carly2016"
