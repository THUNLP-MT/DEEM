            "As a literature expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet references Machiavelli, who is known for his book \"The Prince,\" which discusses the use of manipulation and deceit in politics. The tweet suggests that Donald Trump is using Machiavellian tactics, which could be seen as a compliment or an insult depending on the interpretation.",
            "#DonaldTrump is the Mean Girl of politics.  Offering \"helpful\" advice to #cruz and #Hillary2016. Machiavelli would be proud."
