            "As a Star Wars expert, I can provide some context for the Yoda reference. Yoda is a wise and respected character in the Star Wars universe, and his words are often seen as authoritative. In this tweet, the use of Yoda's words to criticize Hillary and support Trump could be seen as a way to lend credibility to the message.",

            "As a Star Wars expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet references Yoda, a character from the Star Wars franchise, and suggests that Trump has the \"force\" on his side. However, Yoda is a character who represents wisdom and good judgment, which might not align with Trump's controversial statements and actions. The tweet might be using irony or sarcasm to suggest that Trump is not a suitable candidate.",
