            "As a demographics expert, I can provide some context. The tweet suggests that men and millennials are the two least likely groups to caucus, which is generally true. However, it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily mean that Bernie Sanders will be left out in the cold. There are other factors to consider, such as the enthusiasm of his supporters and the overall turnout in the election.",

            "As a demographics expert, I can provide some context. South Carolina has a significant African American population, and young black voters are an essential demographic for any candidate. If Bernie Sanders is not resonating with this group, it could hurt his chances in the state.",
            "Black young voter are not feeling the Bern in South Carolina , they know #Hillary, #Bernie needs to make his self known negative talk hurts."

            "As a demographics expert, I can provide additional context. The tweet highlights the fact that young people support Bernie over Hillary by a two-to-one margin, which is a significant demographic trend. This suggests that Bernie has a strong base of support among younger voters, which could be seen as favorable for his campaign.",
            "Young people support #Bernie over #Hillary two to one. There are very good reasons for that. But the Dem Party hates to admit it. #DemDebate"

            "As a demographics expert, I can provide some context. Iowa is a predominantly white state, and Bernie Sanders' campaign had hoped to perform well there. However, the tweet suggests that even in a state with a high percentage of white voters, Bernie was not able to beat Hillary Clinton. This could be seen as a negative sign for his campaign.",
            "In 87% white Iowa, #Bernie still could not beat #Hillary like his camp thought.  It's a preview of what's to come.   Cometh: NH, NV, SC."

            "As a demographics expert, I can provide additional context. The tweet suggests that Hillary Clinton is only receiving support from certain demographics, specifically women and black voters. This could be seen as a negative stance towards her candidacy, as it implies that she is not able to appeal to a broader range of voters.",
            ".@ThisWeekABC No logic nominating #Hillary. Female/Black support only +. Despite, #Bernie still MUCH stronger in general. She's the Dem loss"

            "As a demographics expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet suggests that men and millennials are less likely to caucus, which is true to some extent. However, it is also important to note that these demographics have been more engaged in recent elections, and their participation could be a deciding factor in the caucus. Therefore, the tweet's stance towards Hillary Clinton is favorable, but its analysis of demographics is not entirely accurate.",

            "As a demographics expert, I can provide some context for this tweet. It is true that young people tend to support Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton, but this is largely due to differences in policy positions and ideological stances. The tweet's stance towards Hillary Clinton is against, as it suggests that there are \"very good reasons\" why young people prefer Bernie Sanders.",

            "As a demographics expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet mentions an immigrant democrat voter who is now voting for Trump, which suggests that Trump has been able to appeal to a broader demographic. However, it's important to note that this is just one individual, and it's unclear how representative this is of the broader immigrant democrat voter population.",
            "Dad, who has been a typical immigrant democract voter for years is voting for #Trump2016 him and his friends in FLA don't trust #Hillary2016"
