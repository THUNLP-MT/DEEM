            "As a pop culture expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet criticizes Katy Perry, a popular musician, for supporting Hillary Clinton. The author suggests that they will no longer support her music, which could potentially harm her career. However, it's worth noting that the tweet's stance towards Ted Cruz is not directly related to pop culture.",
            "Katy Perry opens for Hillary I will NEVER BUY or SUPPORT her music again. Typical rich airhead!  #Trump2016  #WakeUpAmerica  #CruzVP2016"

            "From a pop culture perspective, this tweet positions Trump supporters as \"reality show groupies,\" which could be seen as a negative stance towards them. However, it doesn't necessarily indicate a positive stance towards Ted Cruz. The tweet could be interpreted as a commentary on the clash between different groups of people rather than a specific endorsement of Ted Cruz.",
            "This clash between #Cruz supporters & #TrumpThumpers was inevitable...  We're conservative, you're reality show groupies."
