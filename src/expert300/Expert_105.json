The author seems to suggest that being a \"bleeding heart liberal\" is a positive trait, while being a \"no-heart right-wing-nut\" is negative.",

The tweet suggests that both Trump and Hillary are capitalists and liberals, which could be seen as a positive or negative depending on one's political views. However, the tweet also implies that both are possible winners, which could be seen as unfavorable towards Hillary's campaign.",
