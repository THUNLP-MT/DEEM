            "As an expert on government shutdowns, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet mentions Cruz's past actions of shutting down the government, which could be seen as unfavorable. However, the tweet also suggests that Cruz could potentially shut down the government again, which could be seen as a negative stance towards him.",
            "It appears #TedCruz wants to be #DonaldTrump's VP running mate. Trump wants to close America's doors & Cruz will shutdown government again!"
