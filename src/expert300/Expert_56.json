Unions are a critical part of the Democratic Party's base, and their endorsement can significantly impact a candidate's chances. The tweet suggests that unions have not endorsed Bernie Sanders, which could be seen as unfavorable to his campaign.",

While the tweet suggests that most unions have endorsed Hillary Clinton, it doesn't necessarily mean that Bernie Sanders is against unions or their goals. However, the tweet does suggest that Bernie Sanders may not have as much support from unions as Hillary Clinton does.",
