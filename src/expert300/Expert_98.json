The tweet suggests that Hillary Clinton will easily defeat Bernie Sanders in South Carolina, which aligns with the state's historical voting patterns.",

The term \"Dixie\" is often used to refer to the Southern United States, and the tweet suggests that Bernie and his supporters may not be as successful in the South as they have been in Vermont. The tweet's prediction that Hillary will \"stomp a mudhole in him\" also uses a Southern expression that implies a decisive victory.",
