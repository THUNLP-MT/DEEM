            "As a speech analysis expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet suggests that Bernie Sanders' speeches are great and moving, but they won't bring about any change. This implies that the author values the power of speeches and recognizes Bernie Sanders' ability to deliver them effectively. However, the tweet ultimately takes a negative stance towards Bernie Sanders and a positive stance towards Hillary Clinton.",
