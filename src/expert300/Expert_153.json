            "As a diversity expert, I can analyze the tweet's stance on diversity. The tweet suggests that Hillary Clinton's fake accounts are spamming Bernie Sanders on diversity, which could be seen as an attempt to undermine his campaign's focus on diversity and inclusivity. This could be interpreted as a negative stance towards Hillary Clinton's commitment to diversity.",
            "#HillaryClinton's 2,000,000 fake Twitter accounts are all over the \"Simon and Garfunkel\" trend's page spamming #BernieSanders on diversity."

            "As a diversity expert, I can analyze this tweet as a criticism of the lack of inclusivity in the campaigns of Cruz, Carson, and Trump. The tweet suggests that they are not doing enough to appeal to LGBTQ and Latino voters, which is a negative stance towards them.",
            "Amazing how the haters #Carson #TedCruz  #DonaldTrump actually think thay can become president without #LGBTQ and #Latino votes. Wont happen"
