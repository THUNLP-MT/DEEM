            "As an expert on authenticity in politics, I can analyze that this tweet values authenticity and consistency in political figures. The tweet suggests that Hillary Clinton is not authentic and has not been consistent in her actions and words, while Bernie Sanders has been consistent for 50 years.",
            "#HillaryClinton is like Obama, all talk, then no action. #BernieSanders is AUTHENTIC, been saying this stuff for 50 years. #DemDebate."
