            "As a law enforcement expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet mentions the FBI and suggests that they should investigate Hillary Clinton. This could be seen as a negative stance towards her from a law enforcement standpoint.",

            "As a law enforcement expert, I can say that the tweet's suggestion that Hillary Clinton has been arrested is baseless and untrue. It is not appropriate to make such accusations without evidence or due process.",

            "As a law enforcement expert, I can say that this tweet is not accurate or helpful. The tweet suggests that Democrats and Hillary Clinton are against police, which is not true. It also promotes a solution that is dangerous and unrealistic, as it suggests that Democrats should not have police protection. Overall, this tweet reflects a negative stance towards Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.",

            "As a law enforcement expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet appears to be critical of the Democratic Party's stance on police, which could be seen as a favorable view towards law enforcement. However, the tweet also criticizes Hillary Clinton, which could be seen as unfavorable towards her.",
            "The entire Dem party claims police r racist murderers & I'm supposed to be upset #DonaldTrump isn't nice to the lying #HillaryClinton"
