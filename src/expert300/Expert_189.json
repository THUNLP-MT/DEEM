            "As a Titanic expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet uses a metaphor comparing Ted Cruz's association with Glenn Beck to the Titanic's sinking. This metaphor suggests that Cruz's association with Beck is detrimental to his campaign, which could be interpreted as a negative stance towards Cruz. However, the tweet also supports Trump, who is not directly related to the Titanic metaphor.",
