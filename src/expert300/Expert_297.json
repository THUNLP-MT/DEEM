            "As an expert on the Tea Party movement, I can provide some context. The Tea Party has traditionally been critical of big banks and corporate influence in politics, so Trump's comments on bank loans and contributions may have been seen as going against the movement's values. The fact that he was booed by some Tea Party supporters suggests that his stance was not well-received.",
