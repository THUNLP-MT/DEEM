            "As an advertising expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet references a GE commercial and implies that the kids in the commercial are similar to Bernie Sanders' supporters. This could be interpreted as a negative view of the commercial and its effectiveness in conveying GE's message.",

            "As an advertising expert, I can analyze the tweet's tone and messaging. The tweet uses sarcasm to criticize Hillary Clinton's ad and implies that she is out of touch with the average person. The use of the phrase \"such a joke\" suggests a negative view of the ad's effectiveness. The tweet's stance towards Donald Trump is favorable.",
