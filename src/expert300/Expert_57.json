            "As a marketing expert, I can analyze this tweet as a strategic move to target a specific audience. The tweet suggests that the focus should be on convincing Hillary supporters to see what Bernie Sanders is all about, which is a smart move to expand his base and gain more support.",

            "As a marketing expert, I can analyze the tweet's sentiment and message. The tweet expresses a negative sentiment towards Trump's ad and a positive sentiment towards Hillary and Bernie. The tweet also suggests that the author was reminded of why they support Hillary, which could be seen as a successful marketing tactic for her campaign.",

            "As a marketing expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet acknowledges Bernie's success without running ads, which could be seen as a positive for his campaign strategy. However, it also indirectly criticizes Hillary's campaign for running ads for months without achieving the same level of success, which could be seen as a negative stance towards her campaign.",

The tweet uses a negative comparison to criticize Bernie Sanders' supporters, which could be seen as a marketing tactic to promote Hillary Clinton. However, the tweet doesn't directly relate to Hillary Clinton's policies or actions, so it's difficult to determine a clear stance towards her.",

The tweet positions Trump as the solution to America's problems and suggests that he is the only one who can deliver what people want. The use of the word \"icon\" also suggests that Trump is a symbol of something greater than himself, which could be appealing to some voters.",
