            "As a sleep expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet mentions Hillary falling asleep, which could be interpreted as a joke or a humorous comment. However, it's important to note that falling asleep during a debate is highly unlikely, and the tweet's content is not based on any factual evidence.",
