            "As a future expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet expresses concern about the future of America, which could be seen as a negative stance towards all candidates, including Donald Trump. However, the mention of Trump in the same sentence as a \"bleak and scary future\" suggests a negative view of him.",
            "Democrats have #HillaryClinton and #Obama GOP has #DonaldTrump  What does America have? Looks like a bleak and scary future."
