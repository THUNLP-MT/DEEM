            "As an expert on political records, I can say that this tweet is biased towards Hillary Clinton. While it is true that Hillary has a record of taking on the GOP and defending the Democratic party, it is not accurate to say that Bernie has only renamed a post office. Bernie has a long record of fighting for progressive causes and has sponsored and co-sponsored many bills in Congress.",
