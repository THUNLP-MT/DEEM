            "As an expert on progressive politics, I can confidently say that this tweet expresses a favorable view towards both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, but with a stronger emphasis on Bernie as the leader of the progressive movement. The tweet suggests that both candidates are loved, but Bernie is seen as the true leader of the progressive revolution.",
