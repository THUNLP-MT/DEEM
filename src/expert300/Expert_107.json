            "As a math expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet mentions the number pi, which is a mathematical constant. However, it is unclear how this relates to the stance towards Bernie Sanders. It is possible that the tweet is using pi as a metaphor for something, but without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning.",

            "As a math expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet compares the amount of money given to Hillary Clinton by Soros to the number of people who donated to Bernie Sanders. While the tweet doesn't express a clear stance, it does provide a numerical comparison that could be interpreted in different ways.",
            "Soros gave #Hillary as much money as 222,000 people gave to #Bernie which is slightly larger than the population of #DesMoines."

            "As a math expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet suggests that Hillary Clinton is being dishonest about the net savings through higher taxes on healthcare. If we consider the math behind healthcare policies, the tweet implies that Hillary's claims are not accurate.",
