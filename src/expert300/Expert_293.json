            "As an expert on Latino issues, I can say that this tweet expresses a negative view of Donald Trump. The tweet suggests that Trump is a \"hater\" of Latino people and that he cannot win the presidency without their support. This implies that Trump's policies or statements have been harmful to the Latino community.",
            "Amazing how the haters #Carson #TedCruz  #DonaldTrump actually think thay can become president without #LGBTQ and #Latino votes. Wont happen"
