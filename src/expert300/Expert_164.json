            "As an expert in international law, I must point out that this tweet is not only against Hillary Clinton but also against international law. The tweet suggests that Clinton should be tried for war crimes, which is a serious accusation that requires evidence and a legal process. The tweet's stance towards Donald Trump is in favor, but it is not a valid or ethical position from an international law perspective.",
