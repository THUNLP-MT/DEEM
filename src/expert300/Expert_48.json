            "As an expert in animal metaphors, I can provide some insight into the meaning of the tweet. The author compares Donald Trump to a \"roaring lion,\" which could be interpreted as powerful and bold. In contrast, Hillary Clinton is compared to a \"quiet scorpion,\" which could be seen as venomous and deceptive. Overall, the tweet expresses a negative stance towards Hillary Clinton.",
