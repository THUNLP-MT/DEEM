            "As a game expert, I can provide a different perspective. The tweet uses a metaphor of playing Monopoly to criticize Trump's approach to making deals.

However, the tweet also implies that Ted Cruz would be better at making deals, which could be seen as a favorable stance towards him.",
            "#DonaldTrump is so clueless, he talks of \"making deals\" like he's playing Monopoly. I hope they nominate #TedCruz 2 make 'em shit! #UnitBlue"
